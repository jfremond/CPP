Remove all void from default constructors and destructors
as it's a bad practice in CPP to put void parameters in functions
If it's not done yet, change all CC by CXX and CFLAGS by CXXFLAGS in Makefiles
Remove -c from CXXFLAGS, move it to %.o:%.cpp rule and call CXXFLAGS when linkng objects into exectutable
